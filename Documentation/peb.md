# Understanding the PEB: Process Environment Block Exploration

## What Is The PEB?

I wanted to explore one of Windows' most fascinating internal structures: the Process Environment Block (PEB). This structure is like an identity card for every running program on your system. It contains critical information about a process, including:

- What command line was used to start it
- Where the executable file is located 
- What modules (DLLs) it has loaded
- Various flags that control how it behaves

## Why This Is Interesting

The PEB exists in a special area of memory that's accessible to both the Windows kernel and the user-mode process. This makes it a unique interface between these two worlds. By understanding and manipulating the PEB, we can learn a lot about how Windows manages processes.

## My Educational Implementation

In the `peb_spoof.c` file, I've created functions to explore PEB manipulation techniques. This is purely for educational purposes to understand how process information is stored and accessed. Let me walk you through the key components:

### Getting Access to the PEB

The first challenge is safely accessing the PEB structure. Windows doesn't provide a straightforward API for this, so I implemented `GetProcessEnvBlock()`:

```c
static PVOID GetProcessEnvBlock() {
    // Get PEB via TEB (Thread Environment Block)
    // Different implementation for 32-bit vs 64-bit
    // ...
}
```

This function uses architecture-specific techniques to find the PEB. On 64-bit systems, it tries to use the documented `RtlGetCurrentPeb()` function first, then falls back to reading the Thread Environment Block (TEB) directly if needed.

### Memory Mapping Techniques

One of the most interesting parts is how I create "hidden" memory regions for string storage:

```c
static BOOL AllocateHiddenStringBuffers(const wchar_t* cmdLine, const wchar_t* path, 
                                       PWSTR* outCmdLine, PWSTR* outPath) {
    // Create a memory section with two views
    // One read-only, one write-only
    // ...
}
```

This function demonstrates an advanced memory management technique using memory sections with multiple views. This creates a separation between the memory used for writing values and the memory used for reading them - a concept similar to what memory-safe programming languages implement internally.

### Safe Memory Manipulation

When working with system structures, it's crucial to be careful about memory access. I implemented `SafeWriteMemory()` as a safer alternative to direct memory writes:

```c
static BOOL SafeWriteMemory(PVOID target, PVOID source, SIZE_T size) {
    // Change memory protection
    // Copy data
    // Restore protection
    // ...
}
```

This function temporarily changes memory protection settings to write data, then restores them - preventing accidental memory corruption.

### The Main PEB Exploration Function

The heart of this educational component is the `SpoofPEB()` function:

```c
BOOL SpoofPEB(const wchar_t* fakeCmdLine, const wchar_t* fakePath) {
    // Get PEB pointer
    // Allocate shadow memory
    // Patch process parameters
    // ...
}
```

In my educational simulation version, this function explains what it would do at each step rather than actually modifying the PEB. It demonstrates how a process could theoretically alter its own metadata.

## The Memory Section Technique

One of the most technically interesting aspects is the use of memory sections with dual views:

1. I create a shared memory section using `NtCreateSection`
2. I map this section twice:
   - One view with read-only access (`g_ReadMirror`)
   - Another with write access (`g_WriteMirror`)
3. When I write to the write view, the changes appear in the read view
4. This creates a "one-way" memory pattern that helps illustrate memory security concepts

## Structure of the RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS

The real target of this exploration is the `RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS` structure within the PEB, which contains:

- `CommandLine`: The command arguments used to start the process
- `ImagePathName`: The path to the executable file
- Other information like current directory, environment variables, etc.

In Windows internals, these fields are stored as `UNICODE_STRING` structures, which have a specific format that includes:
- A buffer pointer
- The string length
- The maximum string capacity

## Why This Matters for Security Research

Understanding these structures is valuable for several security research areas:

1. **Malware Analysis**: Researchers need to understand these techniques to identify suspicious behavior
2. **Defensive Security**: Building better detection systems requires knowledge of what to look for
3. **System Programming**: Creating system-level tools often requires deep Windows internals knowledge

## Educational Takeaways

Through this exploration, I've demonstrated:

1. How to access internal Windows structures safely
2. Advanced memory management techniques
3. The relationship between process identity and system metadata
4. Safe approaches to system programming

## In Conclusion

The PEB exploration component is perhaps the most technically sophisticated part of this project. It demonstrates advanced Windows internals concepts while providing educational insights into how processes manage their identity within the operating system.

By studying these techniques in a controlled, educational context, we can better understand both the security implications and the elegant design of the Windows process management system.
